 Creating a remixable game on Koji
----------------------------------

In this tutorial, we will go through the process of creating a remixable https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/rxkd[Falling Objects^] game with an existing https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[p5.js Game Template^] as our starting point.

This tutorial assumes you've already gone through the https://developer.withkoji.com/tutorials/getting-started/your-first-project[Getting Started Tutorial^] and are familiar with the basics of Koji.

Let's get started by cloning the https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[Game Template]. You can do that by clicking on the *Koji logo* on the upper right corner, then *Advanced*, then find the *Fork* button.

You are free to choose between using the Koji web editor or http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/use-git[cloning the newly created project to your local environment].

If you get stuck at any point, feel free to ask for help in our https://discord.gg/kMkjJQ6Phb[Discord Server], or e-mail me at *marko@withkoji.com*

You can also find an overview of the whole game template inside the *README* contained inside the project after you clone it.


Game Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Falling Objects is a simple game where the player tries to collect as many falling objects as they can without them falling off the screen.

Player loses a life if an object falls down, and the game is over when there are no lives left.

Player moves the character horizontally on the bottom by touching or clicking anywhere on the screen.

Setting up `koji.json`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, let's define our game assets. 

Inside of `koji.json`, you will find the `remixData` object.
Let's add some entries to it.

We will need images for our Player and Collectible objects:


`"imgPlayer": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/x0kfr-player.png"`

`"imgCollectible": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/5f618aa2-e515-49a1-adb2-42dfb88a6f59/userData/1d6jr-donut.png"`

image:https://images.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/x0kfr-player.png[alt="player cat",width=128,height=128]
image:https://images.koji-cdn.com/5f618aa2-e515-49a1-adb2-42dfb88a6f59/userData/1d6jr-donut.png[alt="collectible donut",width=128,height=128]

As well as sounds for when the player collects or misses anything:

`"sndCollect": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/ydx3v-collect01onlineaudioconverter.com.mp3.mp3",`


`"sndLoseLife": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/vqnq8-loseLife.mp3.mp3",`

[NOTE]
It's preferrable that your sound assets are prefixed with `snd`. That way, they'll be loaded automatically during `preload`.

You will also notice that there are already some other entries in our `remixData` by default.

Let's also modify the `title` and `backgroundImage` entries to give our game a more distinct look:

`"title": "Catch The Donuts"`

`"backgroundImage": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/377f7596-8edf-44b1-994d-f9926b3aa641/userData/682dt-G68b11.png"`

Your `remixData` object should now look something like this:

[source,json]
--------------
"remixData": {
    "music": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/45cdb5ca-8318-4318-8271-d0e422e790e0/hjdo0-music.mp3",
    "musicVolume": 0.25,

    "imgParticles": [

  },
--------------

*Don't forget to save your changes!*

If you have a Live Preview running (right side of your screen in the Web Editor), you'll notice that the background image has already changed, as well as the player image in the main menu!

Loading assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we've added our assets to `remixData`, we need to load them inside our game so we can use them later.

We will do all of our loading in `frontend/src/Components/Game/preload.js`

We do not have to do anything to load our sounds, since they will be loaded automatically as their keys are prefixed with `snd`.

To load images, we can use `addImage()`:

[source,javascript]
const preload = () => {
    const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
    ...
    addImage('player', remixValues.imgPlayer, game.playerSize);
    addImage('collectible', remixValues.imgCollectible, 100);
    ...
}

Note that we've used `game.playerSize` as player size. We need to define that as well. We will define all of our game settings in `initializeValues()`:
[source,javascript]
import isMobile from '../../Utils/isMobile'
...
const initializeValues = () => {
    ...
    game.playerSize = isMobile() ? 90 : 110;
}

Since there's a considerable difference in mobile and desktop display sizes, we can change our `playerSize` according to the device using the `isMobile()` function provided by the template.

We can also change game instructions here by modifying `game.instructions` property.

Change it to something like: 

`game.instructions = "Touch to move around!";`

Adding a Player
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This template uses an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system[Entity] system, so we can extend the base `Entity` class from our template to define the game objects.

Let's go to `Player.js` inside of our `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities` folder.

[NOTE]
This template already has an example `Player` class defined, so no need to create a new file, we can use that!

Let's modify the constructor to give it an image that we've already loaded, and give it a size:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'

export default class Player extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options) {
        super(x, y, options);
        
        this.img = game.images.player;
        this.size = game.playerSize;
    }

    update(){

    }
}
-------------------

[NOTE]
`update()` function should also be cleared in case there's any example code in it. We will modify it later.

That was all we needed to do to have our `Player` object ready to be drawn to the screen! Now we just need to instantiate it.

Head over to `frontend/src/Components/Game/setup.js` where you'll find the `init()` function. Clear everything inside it and change it to:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from "."
import Player from './Entities/Player'

...

const init = () => {
    const x = game.width / 2;
    const y = game.height - 160;
    const player = new Player(x, y);
    game.addEntity(player);
    game.player = player;
}
-------------------

Here we defined our `x` and `y` coordinates to spawn our Player on (center bottom of the screen), added the `player` instance to our list of entities, and also assigned the player object to our game instance so we can easily access it later.


If we take a look at the game preview now and click on the Play button, we should see our Player image on the bottom of the screen.

image:https://i.imgur.com/jynK73v.png[alt="screenshot player",width=256,height=256]

Awesome!

But since this is a game we're making, we want our `Player` to move when we tell it to, not just sit around!

To do that, let's head back to our `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Player.js` file.

We'll define a new function to handle our player movement, call it `handleControls()`, and put it inside `update()` which runs every frame:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..';
import { Smooth } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'
...

update(){
    this.handleControls();
}

handleControls(){
    if(!game.isTouching) return; // Do nothing if we're not touching or clicking

    this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.mouseX, 13);
}
-------------------

We're using the `Smooth` function from the template's `Game/Utils/EasingFunctions.js` file, so the player can move smoothly to its goal, which is our `game.mouseX` touch coordinate. The number parameter at the end determines how quickly that happens. The higher it is, the slower the player will move. Feel free to experiment with different numbers if you wish!

If we try the game now, the player should move left and right wherever we touch or click on the screen.

This works, but let's make it prettier!

What if the player tilted slightly in the direction it's moving? We also don't want to move outside of the screen for any reason.

Let's add those features by expanding our `Player` class some more:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..';
import { Smooth } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'
...

export default class Player extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options) {
        ...
        this.goalRotation = 0;
    }
}

update(){
    this.handleControls();

    this.rotation = Smooth(this.rotation, this.goalRotation, 8);
}

handleControls(){
    if(game.isTouching){
        this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.mouseX, 13);
        this.keepInsideScreen();

        const isTouchingFarEnough = Math.abs(this.pos.x - game.mouseX) > this.size / 2;

        if (isTouchingFarEnough) {
            const movingDirection = Math.sign(game.mouseX - this.pos.x);
            this.goalRotation = movingDirection * game.radians(15);
        }else{
            this.goalRotation = 0;
        }
    }else{
        this.goalRotation = 0;
    }
}

keepInsideScreen() {
    const limitLeft = this.size / 2;
    const limitRight = game.width - this.size / 2;
    this.pos.x = game.constrain(this.pos.x, limitLeft, limitRight);
}
-------------------

With `keepInsideScreen()`, we're simply constraining the player's `x` coordinate so it doesn't overlap or go outside the screen boundaries.

Then we check if we're touching outside of the player, in which case we're setting `goalRotation` slightly to that side.

Looking good so far!


Adding Collectibles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have the player. Now we need something to collect!

Let's make a new `Collectible.js` file inside the `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities` folder, and give it some properties:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options) {
        super(x, y, options);
        
        this.img = game.images.collectible;
        this.size = game.random(game.collectibleSizeMin, game.collectibleSizeMax);
        this.tag = "collectible";
        this.velocity.y = game.random(game.speedMin, game.speedMax);
        this.rotSpeed = game.random(-0.03, 0.03);
        this.isCollected = false;
    }
}
-------------------

We have a bit more going on here than with player. Let's break it down:

`this.img = game.images.collectible` - give it a previously loaded `Collectible` image

`this.size = game.random(game.collectibleSizeMin, game.collectibleSizeMax)` - set the size to a random value between `game.collectibleSizeMin` and `game.collectibleSizeMax`

`this.tag = "collectible"`` - set the tag, so we can find it later

`this.velocity.y = game.random(game.speedMin, game.speedMax)` - set the vertical velocity to a random value between `game.speedMin` and `game.speedMax`

`this.rotSpeed = game.random(-0.03, 0.03)` - set the rotation speed to a random value between `-0.03` and `0.03`

`this.isCollected = false` - a boolean to track whether it's been collected or not

In order for this to work, we need to define some more values inside the game settings, so we'll head back to `frontend/src/Components/Game/preload.js`, and in `initializeValues()` add:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const initializeValues = () => {
    ...
    game.speedMin = 2;
    game.speedMax = 4;
    game.collectibleSizeMin = isMobile() ? 55 : 85;
    game.collectibleSizeMax = isMobile() ? 75 : 105;
}
-------------------

Since the `Entity` class has its movement already handled based on the `velocity` property that we already modified in the `Collectible` constructor, that's all we needed to do to have our Collectibles fall down indefinitely!

Now let's try spawning some!

Collectibles need to spawn throughout the game, and not just in the beginning like the Player does. We can do that inside `frontend/src/Components/Game/draw.js`. Every function placed here will run with each game frame.

We'll define a new `manageSpawn()` function that will handle our spawning logic, then put it inside `draw()`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
import Collectible from './Entities/Collectible'

const draw = () => {
    ...
    manageSpawn();
}

const manageSpawn = () => {
    game.spawnTimer -= game.delta();

    if (game.spawnTimer <= 0) {
        spawnCollectible();
        game.spawnTimer = game.random(game.spawnPeriodMin, game.spawnPeriodMax);
    }
}

const spawnCollectible = () => {
    const x = game.random(0, game.width);
    const y = -game.collectibleSizeMax;
    game.addEntity(new Collectible(x, y));
}
-------------------

Every frame, we'll decrease `game.spawnTimer` by `game.delta()`. Once it reaches `0`, we spawn a new collectible at a random point above the screen and reset the timer to a random value between `game.spawnPeriodMin` and `game.spawnPeriodMin`.

Once again, we need to define the new values in game settings:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const initializeValues = () => {
    ...
    game.spawnPeriodMin = 1.5;
    game.spawnPeriodMax = 2;
    game.spawnTimer = 0.1;
}
-------------------

If you start the game now, you should see a bunch of donuts appearing every `1.5` to `2` seconds and falling to the bottom.

image:https://i.imgur.com/mtzJFG2.gif[alt="screenshot player",width=160,height=160]

That's nice and all, but how do we catch them? No point in falling donuts if you can't eat them!


Collision Checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check for collisions between Player and Collectibles, we'll modify `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Player.js` again.

Let's add a new function to do that, and put it in `update()`!

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
import { CollisionCircle } from '../Utils/Collision'

export default class Player extends Entity {
    ...

    update(){
        ...
        this.checkCollisions();
    }

    checkCollisions() {
        const collectibles = game.findByTag('collectible');

        collectibles.forEach(collectible => {
            if (!collectible.isCollected && CollisionCircle(this, collectible)) {
                collectible.onCollect();
            }
        });
    }
}
-------------------

First, we use `game.findByTag()` to filter our collectibles, then run through each one asking if they are colliding with the `Player`.

For that, we're using `CollisionCircle()`, provided by the game template (from `frontend/src/Components/Game/Utils/Collision`), which takes two `Entities` as arguments.

So if we are indeed colliding, and the collectible in question hasn't already been collected, we trigger the `onCollect()` handler on the target collectible which we will define next.

Back to `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Collectible.js`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    ...

    
    onCollect() {
        this.isCollected = true;
    }
}
-------------------

This just sets our `isCollected` flag to true.

Now, we could just remove our Collectible object now and be done with it, but we don't want this to be like any other tutorial. Let's spice things up a bit!

Instead of the Collectible just disappearing upon contact, let's have the Player attract it like a magnet and make it explode into particles! That sounds more fun!

So let's override Collectible's `update()` function, but also keep the original behavior:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import playSound from '../Utils/playSound'
import { Smooth, Ease, EasingFunctions } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'
import { spawnParticles } from '../Effects/Particle'
import { spawnFloatingText } from '../Effects/FloatingText'

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options){
        super(x, y, options);
        ...

        this.animTimer = 0;
    }

    update(){
        super.update();
        this.handleAnimation();
    }

    handleAnimation() {
        if (!this.isCollected) return;

        this.animTimer += game.delta() * 4;

        this.scale.x = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeInCubic, this.animTimer, 1, -0.95);
        this.scale.y = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeInCubic, this.animTimer, 1, -0.95);
        
        this.moveTowardsPlayer();

        if (this.animTimer >= 1) this.getCollected();
    }

    moveTowardsPlayer() {
        if (!this.isCollected) return;

        this.velocity.y = Smooth(this.velocity.y, 0, 8);
        this.rotSpeed = Smooth(this.rotSpeed, 0, 8);
        this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.player.pos.x, 12);
        this.pos.y = Smooth(this.pos.y, game.player.pos.y, 12);
    }

    getCollected() {
        this.shouldBeRemoved = true;

        spawnParticles(game.player.pos.x, game.player.pos.y, 10, { img: this.img });

        const x = game.player.pos.x;
        const y = game.player.pos.y - game.player.size * 0.75;

        spawnFloatingText("+1", x, y);
        game.addScore(1)
        playSound(game.sounds.collect);
        game.player.pulse();
    }
}
-------------------

That's a lot of code! Let's break it down:

So, once set our `isCollected` value to true, things start to happen.

In `handleAnimation()`, we advance the `animTimer` property by `game.delta() * 4`, then we use that `animTimer` value to do some `EasingFunctions` and shrink the scale from 1 to 0.05.

At the same time, in `moveTowardsPlayer()`, we're doing several things at once:

* `this.velocity.y = Smooth(this.velocity.y, 0, 8)` - Gradually disable the existing vertical velocity
* `this.rotSpeed = Smooth(this.rotSpeed, 0, 8)` - Start spinning wildly
* `this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.player.pos.x, 12)`
* `this.pos.y = Smooth(this.pos.y, game.player.pos.y, 12)` - Quickly move towards the player location

Once `animTimer` has gone up to `1` (in about `0.25` seconds), Easing animation will be over and that's when the actual collecting happens with `getCollected()`.

Then finally, in `getCollected()`, we:

* Set the `shouldBeRemoved` flag to `true`, which lets the game know this object will be deleted in the next frame.
* Spawn 10 particles at Player's position and give them the same image as the Collectible.
* Spawn a `+1` floating text a little above the player
* Add 1 to game score
* Play the `collect` sound.
* Call `game.player.pulse()`, which resets Player's "pulse" animation. We don't have that animation yet, so let's set it up! Also, remember when we set the `game.player` property. We finally made use of it!

Back to `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Player.js`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import { Smooth, Ease, EasingFunctions } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'

export default class Player extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options){
        super(x, y, options);
        ...

        this.animTimer = 0;
    }

    update(){
        ...
        this.handleAnimation();
    }

    handleAnimation() {
        if (this.animTimer > 1) return;

        this.animTimer += game.delta();

        const intensity = 0.3;
        this.scale.x = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeOutElastic, this.animTimer, 1 + intensity, -intensity);
        this.scale.y = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeOutElastic, this.animTimer, 1 - intensity, +intensity);
    }

    pulse() {
        this.animTimer = 0;
    }
}
-------------------

As you can see, it's a similar animation setup as in `Collectible`.

We're incrementing the `animTimer` property as long as it's below `1`, because our `EasingFunctions` only work for values between `0` and `1`.

Then we modify the scale again, but this time we're using the `easeOutElastic` function, which gives us a nice bouncy effect.

`pulse()` function just resets the `animTimer` to `0`, which restarts the animation.

Now it's looking better!

Checking for missed Collectibles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like all good things in life, this game, too, has to come to an end somehow!

To do that, we'll have to check if any of the collectibles went past the player and off the screen.

Let's go back to `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Collectible.js` and add that check:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import playSound from '../Utils/playSound'

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    ...

    update(){
        ...
        this.checkIfMissed();
    }

    checkIfMissed() {
        if (game.gameOver) return;

        const isBelowScreen = this.pos.y > game.height + this.size / 2;
        if (isBelowScreen) this.onMiss();
    }

    onMiss() {
        game.loseLife();
        playSound(game.sounds.loselife);
        game.camera.shake(0.25, 12);
        this.shouldBeRemoved = true;
    }
}
-------------------

First, we check the Collectible's `pos.y` coordinate, and if it's higher the lower edge of the screen, we trigger the `onMiss()` function, where we:

* Trigger a `loseLife` event. The template makes sure that the game automatically ends when there are no lives left.
* Play a `loselife` sound
* Shake the camera a bit to amplify that negative effect
* Set the `shouldBeRemoved` flag to `true`, to make sure our object will be deleted from memory in the next frame.

[NOTE]
Deleting unused objects from memory is an especially important step in order to prevent memory leaks from prolonged gameplay sessions which can result in performance slowdown and eventually a crash

Managing difficulty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this stage, our game is finally playable!

But right now, it might be a little too repetitive and easy. We want to make it competitive and progressively more difficult as time passes, so our players have more incentive to compete on the leaderboard.

There's an easy way to do that!

Remember how we had a function that handled our spawn logic? We can do something similar this time.

Let's define some settings in `frontend/src/Components/Game/preload.js` first:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const initializeValues = () => {
    ...
    game.difficultyIncreasePeriod = 2;
    game.difficultyIncreaseTimer = 2;
    game.difficultyIncreaseAmount = 0.1;
    game.speedLimit = 12;
    game.speedIncrease = 0.1;
}
-------------------

Then we can create our handler function in `frontend/src/Components/Game/draw.js`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const draw = () => {
    ...
    manageDifficulty();
}

const manageDifficulty = () => {
    game.difficultyIncreaseTimer -= game.delta();

    if (game.difficultyIncreaseTimer <= 0) {
        increaseDifficulty();
        game.difficultyIncreaseTimer = game.difficultyIncreasePeriod;
    }
}

const increaseDifficulty = () => {
    if (game.spawnPeriodMin > game.spawnPeriodLimit) {
        game.spawnPeriodMin -= game.difficultyIncreaseAmount;
        game.spawnPeriodMax -= game.difficultyIncreaseAmount;
    }

    if (game.speedMax < game.speedLimit) {
        game.speedMax += game.speedIncrease;
        game.speedMin += game.speedIncrease;
    }
}
-------------------

So, using our timer we periodically increase our difficulty by changing some game settings, up to a point. It's important to set a limit to prevent the game getting totally unplayable at some point, which most players don't really consider a fun experience.

Every time the difficulty increases, we:

* Slightly decrease the period at which Collectibles spawn
* Slightly increase the falling speed of Collectibles

Congratulations!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We've actually finished developing our game!

Of course, you can go ahead and try modifying something, or adding a new feature. Everything's a bonus from now on!

Remix
-----

We've finished the main part of our game. But this is Koji! We don't stop here. 

We want this game to be easily remixable by other people and shared everywhere online!

Let's explore a new section of the game template.

If you open `frontend/src/Components/Remix/index.js`, you'll find some workflow already set up.

[NOTE]
You can see what your Remix menu currently looks like in the `Remix` tab of the http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/testing-templates#_using_the_koji_debugger[Debugger], or inside the Live Preview from your web editor

*Background Image* and *Music* customization are already handled by the template, so we can just leave them as they are.

Luckily, since we've already made a generic `Player` class that uses `imgPlayer` for its image, we can take advantage of the template once more because it already has everything set up for our player to be customizable.

image:https://i.imgur.com/PvpEy66.png[alt="screenshot player",width=256,height=256]

To test it out, try changing the `Player` image and going into preview mode. Our player is different now! 

But what about our `Collectible` image? Let's make that customizable too, using a similar workflow as with `Player`.

First, let's make a State Hook that will represent our `Collectible` image, and assign the initial values:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const Component = () => {
    ...
    const [imgCollectible, setImgCollectible] = useState("");
    const [isCollectibleInvalid, setIsCollectibleInvalid] = useState("");
    ...

    const assignInitialValues = () => {
        const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
        ...

        setImgCollectible(remixValues.imgCollectible);

        ...

    })
}
-------------------

Notice that we also created an `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook. We will need this to make sure the user has actually uploaded an image. We don't want them to publish the game without one.

Then in `assignInitialValues()`, which is inside our useEffect Hook when the Remix components mounts, we assign the initial value from `koji.json`:

We also need to define some functions that will let us change or delete our collectible image:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const Component = () => {
    ...

    const changeCollectible = async () => {
        const image = await Koji.ui.capture.image();
        if (!image || image === "") return;

        setImgCollectible(image);
        setIsCollectibleInvalid(false);
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: image })
        updateGame();
    }

    const deleteCollectible = async () => {
        setImgCollectible("");
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: "" })
        updateGame();
    }

}
-------------------

To capture our image, we're using `@withkoji/core` package that lets us easily upload an image, paste one from a link or choose from one of the asset packs.

`Koji.ui.capture.image()` will return `null` in case the user has cancelled image selection, so we also include a simple check to make sure that's not the case.

Then we:

* Update our `imgCollectible` *state hook* with the resulting image
* Reset the `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook
* Update our `imgCollectible` *remix value* with the resulting image
* Update the game

We want to update our game here because we have a running game preview behind our Remix panel. If we change something that wouldn't be instantly previewable inside the game, this step can be skipped.

Inside `deleteCollectible()`, we do the same thing, except we just set our `imgCollectible` to an empty string instead of capturing an image.

Next, let's render the component which represents a collectible image and lets us customize it. We can once again use the existing structure from `Player`.

Find the component that looks like this:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Player"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgPlayer, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeImgPlayer}
        onDelete={deletePlayer}
        isInvalid={isPlayerInvalid}
    />
</div>
-------------------

Make a copy just below it, still inside the `<Section>` component, and modify it to look like this:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Collectible"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgCollectible, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeCollectible}
        onDelete={deleteCollectible}
        isInvalid={isCollectibleInvalid}
    />
</div>
-------------------

Lastly, we want to modify the `finish()` function to prevent the user from publishing if they haven't uploaded an image.

It already has that logic handled for `imgPlayer`, so we can just modify it to include `imgCollectible` as well:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
const finish = async () => {
    if (imgPlayer === "" || imgCollectible === "") {
        setErrorLabel("Complete the required selections to continue.");

        if (imgPlayer === "") {
            setIsPlayerInvalid(true);
        }

        if (imgCollectible === "") {
            setIsCollectibleInvalid(true);
        }

        return;
    }

    await Koji.remix.set({
        backgroundImage,
        music,
        title,
    })
    Koji.remix.finish();
}
-------------------

[NOTE]
We don't need to explicity set `imgPlayer` and `imgCollectible` inside the `Koji.remix.set()` function, because we've already done it with our `onChange` handlers. Setting them here as well won't make any difference in the final result.

That's our `Remix` mode finished! We've just added the ability for users to change the `Collectible` image!

Customizing the thumbnail preview
---------------------------------

The very last thing we need to do before releasing our new game into the wild, is to customize the thumbnail preview, so when users share their remixes, they get nice little previews that people will click on!

Basically, whatever we render inside of `frontend/src/Components/Screenshot/index.js` will be rendered in the thumbnail preview.

[NOTE]
You can see what your thumbnail preview currently looks like in the `Thumbnail` tab of the http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/testing-templates#_using_the_koji_debugger[Debugger], or inside the Live Preview from your web editor

By default, this component already shows `imgPlayer` in the center.

It looks something like this:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgPlayer, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '50%'
    }}
/>
-------------------

Let's move the player down a bit. To do that, just change the `top` value to something like `80%`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgPlayer, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '80%'
    }}
/>
-------------------

Now, let's add some `Collectible` images by duplicating the player's `FeaturedImage` below, and changing their positions around. They don't have to be exactly the same, you can play around and see what you like best. You can even randomize their positions if you want!

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '35%',
        top: '25%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '75%',
        top: '35%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '45%',
        top: '50%'
    }}
/>
-------------------

Once done, your thumbnail preview should look something like this:

Finishing Up
------------

That's it, we just created a *fun and remixable Koji game*!

All that's left to do is to publish it from the *Publish Now* menu, and share it with your friends so they can compete for the top leaderboard spot!

Of course, the project is now your playground. You can go back to modify or add new features, make improvements, anything you can imagine!

Here are some features you can try adding:

* Add horizontal speed to Collectibles
* Multiple Collectible images
* Flip the rules so that you have to avoid everything
* Add more animations to collectibles
* Have the player be able to move in all directions, not just horizontally
* Add keyboard controls
* Add projectiles so you can shoot the falling objects
* Make an MMORPG out of this! [small]#(just kidding)#

You can also post your new game to our https://discord.gg/kMkjJQ6Phb[Discord Server], along with any suggestions and thoughts on how you think we can make this tutorial even better!


You can find the finished game created by following this tutorial https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/ekpy[here].
