= Adding In-Game Purchases to a Koji Game

In this tutorial, we'll go through adding an In-Game Purchase feature to an existing game on Koji.

As our starting point, we are going to fork https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/3ej3[Tower Stack], which was built on top of my https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[p5.js Game Template^].

Some tutorials worth checking out before this if you're new to Koji:

* https://developer.withkoji.com/tutorials/getting-started/your-first-project[Getting Started^]

* https://github.com/markof94/koji-p5-game-tutorial/blob/main/gameTutorial.adoc[Creating a remixable game^]

Koji web editor is recommended for this tutorial, but you are free to http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/use-git[clone the newly created project to your local environment] if you wish.

If you get stuck at any point, feel free to ask for help in our https://discord.gg/kMkjJQ6Phb[Discord Server], or e-mail me at *marko@withkoji.com*

You can check out the finished game https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/2d69[here].

*Let's get started* by cloning https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/3ej3[Tower Stack]. You can do that by clicking on the *Koji logo* on the upper right corner, then *Advanced*, then find the *Fork* button.

== Game Overview

Tower Stack is a hyper-casual game where your goal is to stack blocks as high as you can without missing.

The block you're supposed to place swings from the top of the screen and tapping releases it. Landing it on top of a previous block, you get a point, and if you miss, you lose a life.

The game ends when there are no lives left.

== Our Goal

We already have a working game, so we're just supposed to add a feature that lets players buy more lives, we're going to do that by modifying the endgame behavior. 

Currently, once the game ends, it automatically takes you to to the leaderboard or score submission screen. We are going to make an intervention there and insert a menu that either lets you continue regularly to score submission or lets you buy a new set of lives so you can keep playing.

And the *best part* about it is that whoever remixes this game gets to choose how much this feature costs!

To break it down into steps, we need to:

* Add the `InAppPurchases` entitlement to `koji.json`
* Define a customizable price value in `remixData` inside `koji.json`
* Show a menu when the game ends that lets users take action
* Modify game behavior to suit our new feature
* Use `Koji.iap` from the `@withkoji/core` package to handle our purchase
* Notify the game instance that a purchase has been made and reset the lives
* Make price customizable in `Remix` menu

== Setting up `koji.json`

=== Entitlements

First, we should let Koji know that our new game template will contain `In-App Purchases`.

For that, we need to add an `entitlement`.

If you look inside `koji.json` located in the root of your project, you'll see an object called `entitlements` that looks like this:

[source,json]
-------------
"entitlements": {
    "InstantRemixing": true,
    "InstantRemixingNativeNavigation": true,
    "FeedEvents": true,
    "CustomMetadata": {
        "enabled": true,
        "metadata": {
        "title": "{{remixData.title}}",
        "description": "How high can you stack them?"
        }
    }
}
-------------

Let's add a new property called `InAppPurchases`, so your `entitlements` should now look like this:

[source,json]
-------------
"entitlements": {
    "InstantRemixing": true,
    "InstantRemixingNativeNavigation": true,
    "FeedEvents": true,
    "CustomMetadata": {
        "enabled": true,
        "metadata": {
        "title": "{{remixData.title}}",
        "description": "How high can you stack them?"
        }
    },
    "InAppPurchases": {
        "enabled": true,
        "products": [
            {
                "sku": "extraLives",
                "name": "Extra Lives",
                "price": "{{remixData.price}}",
                "isConsumable": true
            }
        ]
    }
}
-------------

We've just added a product to our template:

* `sku` - this is the string we will use later to look up our product when doing the actual purchase
* `name` - This will be shown on the receipt when users make a purchase
* `price` - Price of our product in USD. We set this to `{{remixData.price}}` which means it will use our custom value. We will define this in the next step.
* `isConsumable` - We set this to `true` to allow this product to be purchased multiple times

=== Remix Data

Still inside `koji.json`, scroll down to the `remixData` object. This is where we can define our customizable values that users can modify while remixing our template.

Let's add a `price` property and set it to `0.1` for now:

[source,json]
-------------
"remixData": {
    ...
    "price": 0.1
  },
-------------


[NOTE]
In order for our product to be registered, we need to *publish from the web editor*. This will allow us to test our purchases from the Koji Debugger later. *The price value also needs to be greater than 0*.


[IMPORTANT]
If working *locally*, you need to push your changes and pull them into the web editor, then publish. More info https://developer.withkoji.com/docs/publish/publish-locally-developed[here]

== Payment Menu Component
Let's make some UI that will enable our players to make purchases.

Go to `frontend/src/Components/View/` and make a new file called `PaymentDialog.js`.

Feel free to copy the whole component into your file: 

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import Koji from '@withkoji/core'
import NavigateNextIcon from '@material-ui/icons/NavigateNext'

    user-select: none;

    &:active{
        transform: translateY(4px);
    }

    svg{
        font-size: 28px;
    }

    &:hover{
        background-color: rgba(240, 240, 255, 1);
    }

`;

const LifeLabel = styled.div`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
`;

const LifeIcon = styled.img`
    width: 24px;
    height: 24px;
    object-fit: contain;
    margin-right: 4px;
`;

const PaymentDialog = (props) => {
    const {
        onPurchase,
        onPurchaseCancel
    } = props;

    const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
    const price = Number(remixValues.price).toFixed(2);
    const lifeIcon = optimizeImage(remixValues.imgLife, 64, 64);

    return (
        <Container >
            <Wrapper>
                <Title>
                    {`GAME OVER`}
                </Title>
                <Button
                    onClick={onPurchase}
                >
                    <LifeLabel>
                        <LifeIcon src={lifeIcon} />
                        {"Get Extra Lives"}
                    </LifeLabel>
                    <div>{`$${price}`}</div>
                </Button>

                <Button
                    style={{ marginBottom: `0` }}
                    onClick={onPurchaseCancel}
                >
                    <div>{"View Leaderboard"}</div>
                    <NavigateNextIcon />
                </Button>
            </Wrapper>
        </Container>
    )
}

export default PaymentDialog;
-------------------

Once rendered, it will look like this:

image:https://i.imgur.com/Ct0KPcV.png[alt="screenshot payment component",width=256,height=256]

As you can see, this component will receive `onPurchase` and `onPurchaseCancel` function props, which will correspond with the two buttons.

One more handy thing to notice is that it reads the price from `koji.json` remix values and displays it on the top button.

Let's render our component!

Inside `frontend/src/Components/View/index.js`, let's create a state hook that controls when we should display our `PaymentDialog`, and then render the component itself:

[source,javascript]
------------------
...
import PaymentDialog from './PaymentDialog'

...

const Component = (props) => {
    ...

    // Create a state hook to let us control 
    // when we should display our PaymentDialog
    const [showPaymentDialog, setShowPaymentDialog] = useState(false);

    ...

    return(
        <Container>
            ...

             {showPaymentDialog &&
                <PaymentDialog />
            }
        </Container>
    )

}
------------------

=== startPurchase()

Remember when we said that `PaymentDialog` component will have `onPurchase` and `onPurchaseCancel` function props? Let's define those functions and pass them:


[source,javascript]
------------------
...
import PaymentDialog from './PaymentDialog'

...

const Component = (props) => {
    ...

    // Create a state hook to let us control 
    // when we should display our PaymentDialog
    const [showPaymentDialog, setShowPaymentDialog] = useState(false);

    ...

    const onPurchase = async () => {
        // Initiating a purchase of "extraLives" product that we defined in koji.json entitlements
        const purchase = await Koji.iap.startPurchase('extraLives');

        // If the purchase object contains a receiptId
        // it means that the purchase was successful
        if (purchase.receiptId) {
            setShowPaymentDialog(false);
            emitEvent('resumeGame');
            emitEvent('resetLives');
            

            // Submit the score just to have some backup in case
            // the player closes the game before submitting later
            if (dataManager.name !== "") {
                await dataManager.submitScore(score);
            }
        }
    }

    // In case the user proceeds to the leaderboard
    const onPurchaseCancel = () => {
        setShowPaymentDialog(false);
        startScoreSubmission();
    }

    return(
        <Container>
            ...

             {showPaymentDialog &&
                <PaymentDialog 
                    onPurchase={onPurchase}
                    onPurchaseCancel={onPurchaseCancel}
                />
            }
        </Container>
    )
}
------------------

==== `onPurchaseCancel()`
* Simply close the menu and proceed to the score submission process.

==== `onPurchase()`:
* `Koji.iap.startPurchase('extraLives')` initializes the purchase process handled by Koji, which opens up the payment modal for our product. 
** `extraLives` is the `sku` value we set in the `InAppPurchase` entitlement in the beginning of this tutorial.
* The returned `purchase` object should contain a `receiptId` property if the transaction was successful, and then we can proceed with our flow:
** Disable `PaymentDialog` by setting the state hook to false
** Emit the `resumeGame` event which the game already has defined
** Emit the `resetLives` event which we'll have to define later, since it wasn't included in this template
** Submit the score if the player has already submitted their name. This is optional but a good thing to have in case they close the tab later while playing, so we'll have at least the latest score saved

[NOTE]
This use case does not require any backend validation, we simply proceed with the flow if the purchase was successful. If you wanted to save some data and later check if the user has already purchased something, you would need to check for receipts on the backend. But let's leave that for another tutorial.


You might have noticed that we're missing the `startScoreSubmission()` function here. We'll extract that function from `onGameOver()`, which is already defined by this template and triggers automatically when the game ends.

Find `onGameOver()` which looks like this:

[source,javascript]
------------------
const onGameOver = async (data) => {
    setScore(data.detail.score);
    if (dataManager.name === "") {
        setTimeout(() => {
            setShowNameDialog(true);
            setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
        }, 3000);
    } else {
        await dataManager.submitScore(data.detail.score);

        setTimeout(() => {
            setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
            setShowLeaderboard(true);
        }, 3000);
    }
}
------------------

And extract the conditional part to a separate function, so it will look like the following:

[source,javascript]
------------------
const onGameOver = async (data) => {
    setScore(data.detail.score);

}

const startScoreSubmission = async () => {
    if (dataManager.name === "") {
        setShowNameDialog(true);
        setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
    } else {
        await dataManager.submitScore(score);

        setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
        setShowLeaderboard(true);
    }
}
------------------

Notice that we also removed both `setTimeout` handlers, since we no longer need a delay before displaying the game over screen and moving to score submission, as that transition is now triggered by user action.

And lastly, let's update `onGameOver()` to behave appropriately based on whether we have the price or not:

[source,javascript]
------------------
const onGameOver = async (data) => {
    setScore(data.detail.score);

    const price = Number(Koji.remix.get().price);

    if (price > 0) {
        setShowPaymentDialog(true);
        emitEvent('pauseGame');
    } else {
        startScoreSubmission();
    }
}
------------------

First, we get the price from `remixData` and make sure it's a number.

If there is a price, we show `PaymentDialog`, otherwise we go straight to score submission and leaderboard.

*Congratulations, that was the hardest part!*

== Updating Game Behavior

Now, we need to make some adjustments to the game instance to acommodate our updates so far. Let's take a quick dive into some of the original game code!

=== Adding a Listener for `resetLives` Event

This template uses CustomEvents to communicate between the game instance and the main component, so we'll respect that in our workflow.

We've already added the `emitEvent(resetLives);` call inside our `onPurchase()` function, so let's add a listener for it!

If you go to `frontend/src/Components/Game/index.js`, you'll find that there are already some listeners defined in the first `useEffect` hook. This is where we'll define our new one:

`window.addEventListener('resetLives', resetLives);`

And make sure to also remove it inside of the `return` function, so it gets deleted when the game component unmounts, to prevent any unwanted leaks:

`window.removeEventListener('resetLives', resetLives);`

We also need to define the callback function that we passed to that listener:

[source,javascript]
------------------
const resetLives = () => {
    game.lives = game.startingLives;
    game.gameOver = false;

    spawnFloatingText("EXTRA LIVES", game.width / 2, game.height / 2, {
        duration: 1,
        maxSize: 45
    });
}
------------------

Here, we do the actual reset of lives.
We also make sure to reset the `game.gameOver` property to `false`, and also spawn some floating text in the middle of the screen to celebrate this wholesome event. If you've done my https://github.com/markof94/koji-p5-game-tutorial/blob/main/gameTutorial.adoc[previous tutorial] or are already familiar with this game template, you could get even more creative here and spawn some *exploding particles* too! The player just spent some cash on this game, they deserve the respect!

=== Modifying Block.js

In the original game, once all lives have been lost, the game "camera" will return to the bottom. We don't need this feature, so let's disable it!

Inside `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Block.js`, find the `handleMiss()` function. It looks like this:

[source,javascript]
------------------
handleMiss() {
    this.hasMissed = true;
    playSound(game.sounds.loselife);

    const distanceFromPreviousBlock = Math.abs(this.pos.x - game.blockDesiredX);
    if (distanceFromPreviousBlock < this.size) {
        this.rotDir = Math.sign(this.pos.x - game.blockDesiredX);
        this.isRotating = true;
    }

    setTimeout(game.loseLife, 400);
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (game.gameOver) {
            moveToStart();
        }
    }, 500);
}
------------------

We want to remove the last part that gets it back to the start, so the final result should look like the following:

[source,javascript]
------------------
handleMiss() {
    this.hasMissed = true;
    playSound(game.sounds.loselife);

    const distanceFromPreviousBlock = Math.abs(this.pos.x - game.blockDesiredX);
    if (distanceFromPreviousBlock < this.size) {
        this.rotDir = Math.sign(this.pos.x - game.blockDesiredX);
        this.isRotating = true;
    }

    setTimeout(game.loseLife, 400);
}
------------------

=== Removing the Original Game Over Text

Since our new `Game Over` text shows up in a new menu, we don't need the original one where the label would slide from the top.

We can disable it by going into `frontend/src/Components/setup.js` and inside `game.loseGame()` function, and removing these two lines:

[source,javascript]
game.ui.instructionsAnimTimer = 0;
game.ui.instructionsFadeOutTimer = game.instructionsFadeOutDuration;

So the whole function should look like this:

[source,javascript]
game.loseGame = () => {
    game.lives = 0;
    game.gameOver = true;
    game.ui.instructionsAnimTimer = 0;
    game.ui.instructionsFadeOutTimer = game.instructionsFadeOutDuration;
    emitEvent('gameOver', { score: game.score });
}

That was all we needed to do acommodate our game to the new way of doing things!

== Testing The Game

To test the new `In-App Purchase` feature we just added, you can use http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/testing-templates#_debugging_in_app_purchases[Koji Debugger] (you need to have some balance in your Koji Wallet for this), or you can temporarily disable the payment process and go just emit the `resetLives` event directly, something like the following:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
const onPurchase = async () => {
    // Comment this for testing, skip the check
    //const purchase = await Koji.iap.startPurchase('extraLives');


    //if (purchase.receiptId) {
        setShowPaymentDialog(false);
        emitEvent('resumeGame');
        emitEvent('resetLives');
        

        // Submit the score just to have some backup in case
        // the player closes the game before submitting later
        if (dataManager.name !== "") {
            await dataManager.submitScore(score);
        }
    //}
}
-------------------

[NOTE]
Make sure to *uncomment* those lines before publishing.

== Remix

The last thing we need to do is make our price customizable when people remix this game.

=== Installing the New Package

For our price input field, we'll use a premade component that already handles all the proper formatting for us, so we don't have to worry about the user entering characters, incorrect price formats etc.

For that, we are using `@anderjason/koji-react-frontend-tools` npm package, which is installed in this template because we're already using some of those components.

Another package we will use is `@anderjason/money`, which is *not* installed, so let's go ahead and do it.

On the bottom of your web editor, you'll see a black panel that looks like this:

image:https://i.imgur.com/VSABST5.png[alt="terminal",width=512,height=64]

- Click on `frontend` to expand it
- Inside of it, press `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to stop the frontend server
- Type `npm install @anderjason/money`, wait for it to finish
- When it's done, type `npm start` to restart the frontend server

=== Price Input Field

Inside `frontend/src/Components/Remix/index.js`:

Let's add a state hook for our `price`, initialize its value and also set a `maxPrice` constant just to make sure users can't abuse anything.

[source,javascript]
------------------
// Don't forget the imports!
import { Money, Currency } from "@anderjason/money";

...

const maxPrice = new Money(100000, Currency.ofUSD());

const Component = () => {
    ...
    const [price, setPrice] = useState(new Money(1, Currency.ofUSD()));

    ...

    useEffect(() => {
        const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
        ...

        // Make sure we get a number
        // Multiplied by 100 because Currency uses that format
        const remixPrice = Number(remixValues.price) * 100;
        setPrice(new Money(remixPrice, Currency.ofUSD()));

        ...
    }, [])

------------------

Then we want to render the `<MoneyInput>` inside `<Card>`, just below the `<Section>` component that contains the block image.

[source,javascript]
------------------
// Don't forget the imports!
import { MoneyInput } from "@anderjason/koji-react-frontend-tools";

...
<Card>
    ...
    <MoneyInput
        placeholderLabel="Price To Refill Lives"
        persistentLabel="Price To Refill Lives"
        defaultValue={price}
        maxValue={maxPrice}
        onChange={(price) => setPrice(price)}
        allowEmpty
        supportLabel={price && price.rawValue > 0 ? "Set price to 0 to disable In-Game Purchases." : `In-Game Purchases disabled.`}
    />
    ...
</Card>
------------------

We can set its props like in the example above.

=== Updating the Price Value

Lastly, we need to update the changed `price` in `koji.json`. To do that, find the `onFinish()` function, still inside the same file, and inside `await Koji.remix.set({...})`, add the following property:

`price: price ? price.rawValue / 100 : 0`

Here, we are just running a check to make sure we don't write a `null` value into `koji.json`, in which case we turn it to `0`.

The resulting `onFinish()` function should now look like this:

[source,javascript]
------------------
const onFinish = async () => {
    if (block === "") {
        setError("Complete the required selections to continue.");

        if (block === "") {
            setIsBlockInvalid(true);
        }

        return;
    }

    await Koji.remix.set({
        backgroundImage,
        music,
        title,
        collectEmails,
        imgBlock: block,
        price: price ? price.rawValue / 100 : 0,
    })

    Koji.remix.finish();
}
------------------

And this is what your resulting remix menu should look like:
